## Instructions

_any number of players with instruments, voices, and sound_


**The organic line is a path of performance based on a map of Cane Creek as it passes by Chapel Hill, North Carolina.**

Vertical lines are demarcations of time you agree upon beforehand. They do not need to be equal or precise.

### Sources
1. An instrument that can express any or all of the pitches: E, F, G, A-flat
2. An object that makes unpitched sounds, like percussion or electronic noises.
3. Your voice.

### Playing the Score

_Allow the organic line to guide your performance. Agree together how you want to use it, e.g. : overall dynamics, rate of change, accompanying visuals, dance movements, field recordings of the rivergraph site, etc. Any of the four parts may be used in layers or strung together. The score may be read from any direction. Any single part may be used for solo performance._

Begin at zero (“0”). Breathe deeply. Make sound when you feel comfortable some time before the first Vertical.
Listen. Be aware of other sounds while you blend. At each Vertical make a change:


1. Numbers indicate anything you choose: repeats of notes or rhythms, ranges of technique, singing or reciting, etc.
2. You can switch Sources or add simultaneous Sources.
3. Where a circle “O” appears, freely improvise.


End together at zero (“0”).
